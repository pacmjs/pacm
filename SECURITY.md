# Security Policy

## üîí Supported Versions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: PACM is currently in early experimental stages. Security support is limited and the project is not recommended for production use.

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 0.1.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental    | Development only |

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously, even in this early stage of development.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/pacmjs/pacm/security) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form with details

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Email: security@pacmjs.com

### What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

Current best-effort timeline:
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Update**: Weekly until resolved

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

- [x] Dependency vulnerability scanning with `cargo audit`
- [x] License and security policy enforcement with `cargo deny`
- [ ] **TODO**: Automated security testing in CI
- [ ] **TODO**: Static analysis security scanning
- [ ] **TODO**: Fuzzing for critical components
- [ ] **TODO**: Code signing for releases

### Security-Related Dependencies

We monitor security advisories for all dependencies:

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
cargo audit

# Check licensing and other policies
cargo deny check
```

### TODO: Additional Security Measures

- [ ] **Cryptographic Code Review**: Expert review of any cryptographic implementations
- [ ] **Supply Chain Security**: Implement supply chain attestation
- [ ] **Sandboxing**: Consider sandboxing for package operations
- [ ] **Privilege Minimization**: Run with minimal required privileges
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- [ ] **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's memory safety, avoid unsafe code where possible

## üîç Security Considerations

### Package Manager Security Risks

As a package manager, PACM faces unique security challenges:

- **Dependency Confusion**: Protection against dependency confusion attacks
- **Typosquatting**: Mitigation strategies for package name confusion
- **Malicious Packages**: Detection and prevention of malicious packages
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Protection against compromised dependencies
- **Code Execution**: Secure handling of package installation scripts

### TODO: Security Features to Implement

- [ ] **Package Signing**: Cryptographic signature verification
- [ ] **Checksum Verification**: Integrity checking for all downloads
- [ ] **Sandbox Execution**: Isolated execution environment for package scripts
- [ ] **Permission Model**: Fine-grained permission system
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- [ ] **Vulnerability Database**: Integration with vulnerability databases

## üìö Security Resources

### Learning Resources

- [Rust Security Guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)
- [OWASP Package Manager Security](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)
- [Supply Chain Security Best Practices](https://slsa.dev/)

### Security Tools

- [`cargo audit`](https://docs.rs/cargo-audit/) - Vulnerability scanning
- [`cargo deny`](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/) - License and security policy enforcement

## ü§ù Security Community

### TODO: Security Community Building

- [ ] **Security Advisory Board**: Establish security experts advisory group
- [ ] **Bug Bounty Program**: Consider bug bounty program for stable releases
- [ ] **Security Partnerships**: Partner with security organizations
- [ ] **Regular Security Reviews**: Schedule periodic security assessments

## üìã Security Checklist for Contributors

When contributing code, please consider:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation for all external inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling (don't leak sensitive information)
- [ ] Use of safe Rust practices (avoid unnecessary `unsafe`)
- [ ] Dependency updates don't introduce vulnerabilities
- [ ] New dependencies are reviewed for security issues

## üìÑ Disclosure Policy

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

1. Work with security researchers to understand and validate reports
2. Develop and test fixes in private
3. Coordinate public disclosure with the reporter
4. Credit researchers in security advisories (if desired)
5. Maintain communication throughout the process

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal

This security policy is subject to change. The latest version will always be available in this repository.
